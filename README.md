# graphics-switcher
- Bash file for switching between NVIDIA and Intel's video cards
- Besides switching between graphics cards, it also fixes the video/screen tearing when using Intel cards.
- ** IMPORTANT ** I haven't figured out so far how to fix the video/screen tearing when using NVIDIA graphics cards, that is why I created this script
  to switch between them.
